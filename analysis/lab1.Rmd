## Lab1 

Assignment: write a code to calculate the variance using vector multiplication.
```{r}
set.seed(2993)
#1000 samples from normal distribution with mean 15, and std=10
s <- rnorm(1000,15,10)
#get sum of squares
b <- rep(1,1000) #create vector with 1000 elements (1) 
sumS <- t(s)%*%b #calculate sum of squares
  
```
